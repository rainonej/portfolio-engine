# @portfolio-engine/engine-core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- cde901a: Upstream hardening: nav CSS baseline, manifest diagnostics, profile schemas, doctor script

  **Nav rendering robustness (P0)**
  - Added `pe-site-*` semantic classes to `Nav.astro` alongside Tailwind utilities, so nav layout holds even when Tailwind utility generation is partial or absent in a downstream build.
  - Added explicit CSS baseline for `.pe-site-header`, `.pe-site-nav`, `.pe-site-brand`, `.pe-site-nav-list`, `.pe-site-nav-link` in `global.css`, with a responsive mobile rule at `≤720px`.

  **Manifest diagnostics (P0)**
  - `ManifestRouteEntry` now includes a required `routeOrigin` and `entrypoint` (relative path from consumer root) for every route. The engine emits `"theme"` for editorial-theme routes and `"consumer-local"` for registry routes. `"consumer-pages"` and `"unknown"` are reserved type values for future use and are not emitted in this release.
  - `EngineManifest` now includes `portfolioEngine` (package versions), `consumerRegistry` (load state and route count), `routeOverrides` (disabled and remapped patterns), and an optional `navWarnings` array.
  - Engine integration validates nav items against active injected routes and emits warnings for items that cannot be matched. Pass `diagnostics: { strictNavRoutes: true }` to `editorialTheme()` to fail the build on nav/route mismatches.

  **Profile schemas (P1)**
  - `@portfolio-engine/schema` now exports `ProfilePersonSchema`, `ProfileCvSchema`, `ProfileExperienceSchema`, `ProfileEducationSchema`, and `ProfileAwardSchema` so downstream sites can import canonical schemas rather than duplicating minimal local definitions.
  - Demo site `content.config.ts` updated to use the exported schemas.

  **Accessibility (P1)**
  - `ImageOrFallback` fallback character is now `aria-hidden="true"` with `role="img"` and `aria-label` on the container, so screen readers get the card title instead of a lone letter.

  **Default copy (P1)**
  - Writing index page now shows "Essays, notes, and selected thinking." subtitle and a neutral empty-state message.

  **Doctor script (P2)**
  - `portfolio-engine` (or `pnpm pe:doctor`) runs the doctor CLI, which reads `.portfolio-engine/manifest.json` and prints a structured diagnostic report: package versions, consumer registry state, route origins and entrypoints, nav warnings, and capabilities. The `portfolio-engine` bin maps directly to the doctor script — no subcommand is needed.

### Minor Changes

- 0aca192: **Consumer registry MVP** ([Epic #81](https://github.com/rainonej/portfolio-engine/issues/81)): Zod-validated `src/registry/portfolio-engine.registry.json`, inject Astro routes from `src/pages-local`, fail on URL collisions with injected theme routes (after remaps), manifest fields `routeOrigin` and `capabilities.consumerLocalRoutes`, and package export `@portfolio-engine/editorial-theme/layouts/Layout.astro` for consumer-local pages.

  - @portfolio-engine/schema@0.1.4

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- c84249e: Ship `dist/` package exports, real `admin-tools` build (Astro routes + API copied to `dist`), Astro peer `^6.0.0`, and publishable `@portfolio-engine/admin-tools` with `publishConfig.access: public`.
- Updated dependencies [c84249e]
  - @portfolio-engine/schema@0.1.3

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- a6e295c: Fix override bridge for Windows SSG builds. Replace `@vite-ignore` dynamic
  imports (which bypassed Vite's compiler and broke Node's ESM loader on Windows)
  with per-surface virtual modules that emit static imports — Vite now processes
  consumer override `.astro` files through its normal pipeline.

  `engine-core` adds `@portfolio-engine:override/<Surface>` virtual modules (one
  per supported surface) that export the consumer component or `null`. `editorial-
theme` updates all five override-capable components to use these static imports
  instead of dynamic `await import()`.

  Also adds `Footer` as a new supported override surface.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix npm package entry points: remove `publishConfig` that rewrote `exports` to missing `dist/` files. Published packages now expose `./src/index.ts` and `./src/*` so Astro/Vite consumers resolve the integration and theme sources correctly.
- Updated dependencies
  - @portfolio-engine/schema@0.1.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c8ff7a: Implement engine-core (Epic 3, Tasks 3.1–3.9): config loader + schema bridge, virtual modules, route discovery + injection, route remap/disable semantics, route registry contract, override resolution, and type injection. Also codifies the v1 no-packaged-public-dir constraint in docs and CI.
- 1e2155e: Tasks 4.3–4.5: implement the consumer-facing `editorialTheme()` integration, define the override surfaces it exposes, and add a working demo site.
  - `editorialTheme(options)` returns an array of integrations: a Tailwind PostCSS integration plus the engine-core integration. Astro flattens nested integration arrays, so the consumer-facing API is unchanged (`integrations: [editorialTheme({ ... })]`). Tailwind is configured internally via `vite.css.postcss.plugins` using the `tailwindcss` package directly; `@astrojs/tailwind` is no longer a dependency.
  - `engine-core/override-resolution.ts` declares four named component override surfaces: `Hero`, `FeaturedWriting`, `TestimonialSection`, `CollaborationSection`. Unknown surface names continue to produce a build-time error.
  - New section wrappers under `editorial-theme/src/components/sections/` check the `@portfolio-engine:overrides` virtual module and render the consumer's override or the theme default.
  - `Layout.astro` reads `overrides.__styles__` and inlines the resolved CSS files as a global stylesheet, providing the `styles[]` extra-CSS override.
  - `examples/demo-site/` is wired up end-to-end (config, content collections, sample entries, public assets) as the canonical consumer reference.
  - `editorial-theme/README.md` replaces the placeholder with a consumer quick-start, schemas, and an override surfaces reference.
